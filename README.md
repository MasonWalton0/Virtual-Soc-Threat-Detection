# Virtual-Soc-Threat-Detection

## Overview
This project simulates a small enterprise Security Operations Center (SOC) environment.
I performed both Red Team attack simulations and Blue Team monitoring and incident response.

## Lab Environment
- Ubuntu Linux (Attacker)
- Windows 11 (Victim)
- Wazuh SIEM (Monitoring & Detection)
- Oracle VirtualBox (Internal Network)

## Attacks Simulated
1. Network reconnaissance (Nmap scanning)
2. Unauthorized login attempts
3. Persistence simulation
4. Suspicious process execution

## Blue Team Activities
- Log collection using Wazuh agents
- Alert analysis
- Incident investigation
- Incident response documentation

## Skills Demonstrated
- SIEM monitoring (Wazuh)
- Incident detection & response
- Log analysis
- Network security fundamentals
- SOC documentation

## Disclaimer
This lab was conducted in an isolated virtual environment for educational purposes only.
